# 🚀 MDXpress Blog - CNP (Compiled N' Portable)

**MDXpress Blog - CNP** is a serverless-friendly version of the original [MDXpress Blog](https://github.com/eshan-singh78/MDXpress-Blog/), reworked to deploy seamlessly on platforms like **Vercel** using **Serverless Functions**.

It’s a markdown-powered, minimal blogging platform that compiles content on-the-fly without any backend server, database, or complex setup.

## ✨ What's New in CNP?

- ✅ **Serverless Architecture**: Powered by Vercel Serverless Functions.
- 🪄 **Vercel-Ready**: No `server.js`, works natively with `vercel dev` and on production deploys.
- 📁 **/api Directory Support**: Each route is handled through functions inside the `/api/` folder.
- ⚙️ **Markdown Compilation**: Still powered by `marked`, now running serverlessly.
- 💅 **Same UI, Better Delivery**: No compromises on theming, dark mode, or user experience.
